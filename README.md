# Books-Prediction-Python-Project
For the DSTI Python Project, I will train a model that predicts a bookâ€™s rating using books.csv dataset. This Project includes exploratory analysis of the data, feature engineering and selection, model training and evaluation.

1- Let's explore the data

2- Data Cleaning & Data Processing

3- Plots of relevant attributes

4- Feature selection : feature engineering, feature pruning and choice justification

5- Models training :

5-1- LinearRegression()

5-1-1 LinearRegression() Model Evaluation

5-2- KNeighborsRegressor()

5-2-1 KNeighborsRegressor() Model Evaluation

5-3- DecisionTreeRegressor()

5-3-1 DecisionTreeRegressor() Model Evaluation

5-4- GradientBoostingRegressor()

5-4-1 GradientBoostingRegressor() Model Evalution

6- Results interpretation
